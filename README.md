# SYNGuard Simulator

SYNGuard Simulator is an educational tool designed to demonstrate an enhanced SYN cookie mechanism that resists SYN flooding attacks using a cryptographically secure nonce and HMAC. The simulator includes a menu-driven interface for starting the server, launching a SYN flood attack, initiating a legitimate TCP handshake, analyzing traffic, and monitoring behavior under denial-of-service conditions.

## 🔧 Features

- **Start SYN Cookie Server**: Listens for SYN requests and replies with HMAC + Nonce-based SYN cookies.
- **Run Legitimate Client**: Sends a proper SYN and completes the three-way handshake using enhanced cookies.
- **Launch SYN Flood**: Simulates a SYN flood attack with multithreading to mimic a realistic distributed DoS scenario.
- **Ping a Target IP**: Useful for verifying network reachability.
- **Show Host IP Address**: Displays the local IP address for server/client config.
- **Analyze PCAP**: Parses .pcap files to verify SYN cookie validation.

## 🌟 Educational Purpose

This tool is meant for cybersecurity students, researchers, and hobbyists looking to better understand:

- Stateless SYN cookie-based defense
- TCP handshake analysis
- SYN flooding detection
- PCAP-level validation of cookies

## 🧪 Environment Setup

- **Python Version**: 3.10+
- **Libraries**:
  - `scapy`
  - `socket`
  - `hmac`
  - `hashlib`
  - `os`, `signal`, `subprocess`, `datetime`, `random`, `threading`, `time`

> Two Kali Linux VMs were used on the same host: one acted as the server, and the other simulated both the client and the attacker roles.

## 🧠 How the Method Works

This simulator uses an HMAC-based SYN cookie computation of the form:

```python
SYN_Cookie = HMAC(Secret_Key, Client_IP || Client_Port || Timestamp)
